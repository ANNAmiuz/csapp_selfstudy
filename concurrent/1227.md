Some network programming texts suggest the following approach for reading and
writing sockets: Before interacting with the client, open two standard I/O streams
on the same open connected socket descriptor, one for reading and one for writing:
FILE *fpin, *fpout;
fpin = fdopen(sockfd, "r");
fpout = fdopen(sockfd, "w");
When the server finishes interacting with the client, close both streams as follows:
fclose(fpin);
fclose(fpout);
However, if you try this approach in a concurrent server based on threads,
you will create a deadly race condition. Explain.

***answer:***
Assume there are two threads. 
thread1: fpin1=3, fpout1=3, fclose(fpin1=3) --> thread2: fpin2=3 --> thread1: fclose(fpout1=fpin2=3)
